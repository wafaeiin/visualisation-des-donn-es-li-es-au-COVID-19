## Dataset
The COVID-19 dataset used in this project is from the **Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University**. It contains:
1. **Daily cases:** Confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries, updated since January 22, 2020.
2. **Archived Data:** Historical daily cases, useful for trend analysis.
3. **WHO Situation Reports:** Reports on epidemiology, clinical cases, and public health measures.

---

## Setup and Requirements
To replicate this analysis, ensure you have:
- **Python** installed (version 3.7 or later).
- Python libraries:
  - `matplotlib`
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `seaborn` (optional for enhanced visuals)
- **Power BI Desktop** for visualization.

Install dependencies using:
```bash
pip install matplotlib pandas numpy seaborn
```

## Project Structure
- **data/**: Contains the dataset files.
- **notebooks/**: Python notebooks used for data analysis.
- **visuals/**: Power BI files and generated images.

## Implementation

### Python Analysis
Python is used to process and visualize the data. The following steps were undertaken:
1. **Data Loading and Cleaning:** 
   - Handled missing values and formatted dates.
2. **Visualization:** 
   - Line graphs to observe case trends.
   - Moving averages for smoothing data.

Add a sample image for a Python-generated graph:
```markdown
![COVID-19 Case Trend](visuals/python_case_trend.png)
```

### Power BI Visualization
Power BI was used for a dynamic and interactive report, highlighting:
- **Key Metrics**: Total confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries.
- **Comparative Analysis**: Trends by country and region.

Add a sample Power BI dashboard image:
```markdown
![COVID-19 Power BI Dashboard](visuals/powerbi_dashboard.png)
```

## Results
### Key Findings
- **Exponential Case Growth**: Reflecting the need for rapid public health response.
- **High Mortality in Low-Income Countries**: Highlights healthcare disparities.
- **Positive Recovery Rates**: Especially in countries with effective public health measures.

### Comparative Analysis
- Countries with high population densities faced more significant case spikes.
- Effective health policies led to better recovery outcomes, as seen in countries like Australia and Norway.

## Conclusion
This project provided hands-on experience in data analysis and visualization, enhancing our theoretical knowledge. The insights derived from COVID-19 data emphasize the critical role of data-driven decision-making in managing public health crises.
